Git
Drop local changes:

Delete all changes not staged for commit:
git status -s | grep ' D ' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs git rm

Resets the current branch to the state of the last commit (HEAD); it resets both the index and the working directory to match the specified commit (effectively removes all the changes since the last commit):
git reset --hard HEAD

Removes untracked files (‘-f’) and directories (‘-d’) from the working directory; it ensures that any new files or directories added since the last commit are also removed:
git clean -df
