- fn dynamically allocates memory for 'temp_buffer' to read chunks of data, 
and 'bytes_read' is initialised to 1 so we enter the while loop to read data
- Inside the loop, as long as there is no newline character in the stash AND 
'bytes_read' is not 0 (i.e. end of file has been reached so no more to read):
	- data is read from the 'fd' into the 'temp_buffer' up to 'buffer_size' 
	of data
	- if an error occurs during read (i.e. return of -1), memory is freed and 
	NULL is returned
	- null-terminator is added at the end of the data read to turn it into 
	a null-terminated string
	- if the 'stash' buffer is empty (NULL), it is initialised using 
	gnl_initialise_str to allocate memory for an empty string
	- data read from 'temp_buffer' is appended to the 'stash' buffer using
	gnl_strjoin, accumulating data into the 'stash' buffer
	- if memory allocation for 'stash' during gnl_strjoin failed, error has 
	occured so break to exit loop

read from the 'fd' is returned
